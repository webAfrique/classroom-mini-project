Complete the 6 functions with proper types in **classroom.ts** and check UI to interact with the form and submit your own grades (on top of the ones that were already provided).

Here's a description of what each function should do:

- `getNumberOfGrades` should return the number of grades.
- `getSumGrades` should return the sum of all the grades.
- `getAverageValue` should return the average value of all grades (the sum of all grades divided by the total number of grades).
- `getPassingGrades` should return all passing grades (10 and above).
- `getFailingGrades` should return all failing grades (9 and below).
- `getRaisedGrades` should return all the grades raised by 1 (grades should not exceed 20).

All the functions receive an array of grades. Each grade is of type number (it has already been converted to a number using Number.parseInt). But, you still need to provide the parameter type for each function.
